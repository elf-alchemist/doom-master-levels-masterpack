Description             : Dumped in the middle of a mining base
			  on Titan, a moon of Saturn, you must
			  acquire three keys to find the exit
			  hidden in the mining headquarters. Since
			  the natives are definitely NOT friendly
			  an exit is a nice thing to find.
================================================================
Revision notes:		  A useless switch accidentally left in has
			  been removed, some textures aligned, and
			  an unpegged doorway fixed.
================================================================

Play notes:               486/66 recommended, this wad is LARGE
