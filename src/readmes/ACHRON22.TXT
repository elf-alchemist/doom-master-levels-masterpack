Description             : CROSSING ACHERON is the second level in the INFERNO
			  series.  Having passed through DANTE'S GATE and
			  survived, you now find yourself in a keep on the
			  shores of the river Acheron. This is the second
			  leg of the journey in your search for Beatrice.
			  Your guide, Virgil, is nowhere to be found.
			  "He's buggered off!" you think to yourself; but
			  you have no time now to even think: you are
			  immediately challenged by several Demons, and in
			  the distance you hear the eerie purring of the
			  Arch-Vile (just be sure not to stare at him for
			  too long before you start running.)  As usual,
			  you dispatch what fiends you may and begin the
			  task at hand.

			  Your goal?  To get the hell out of this place as
			  quickly as possible and find your beloved Beatrice.
			  You only hope that she has already passed through
			  this hell-hole to a safer haven beyond.  If only
			  you could hold her in your arms again, you know
			  what you would say:

			  "Gimme some sugar, Babe."

			  CROSSING ACHERON (pronounced 'ak eron) is the second
			  level in a series that began with DANTE'S GATE. 
			  For any of the two or three of you out there who 
			  have read Dante Alighieri's masterwork
			  THE DIVINE COMEDY -- or even only "Inferno" --
			  I'm sure you've been able to appreciate the many
			  allusions to this work in DOOM. I have tried to
			  take a tack of my own along the same lines. (I do
			  this not only because I think the idea is neat, but
			  so that people will think that I'm very clever.)
			  I'm not so na‹ve as to expect everyone to rush out
			  and get a copy of "Inferno" (I mean, it IS pretty
			  tedious stuff, at times), but it's well worth the
			  read -- and a little patience is a virtue that is
			  often well-rewarded.

			  (By the way: Acheron is a river in Hell (basically).
			  But don't look for any rivers in here: I tried it
			  several different ways and just wasn't convinced.)

			  Thanks.  Hope you like it.

Instructions		: Put ACHRON22.WAD in your DOOM directory, type
			  "doom2 -file achron22.wad -warp 3 -skill <#>"
			  (Or, to play advanced, skill 4, also put the file

			  ACHRON22.)

Disclaimer		: I assume no responsibility for anything of any sort
			  in any way, shape, or form--now, then, henceforeward
			  in this life (or the next several) for any screw-ups

			  associates, employers, pets, neighbors, lovers,
			  congressional representatives, nor any other person--
			  living, dead, or undead -- that you have or will ever
			  have any contact with in even the slightest form.
			  This PWAD has been tested and tested ad infinitum, so
			  it shouldn't mess with your computer or anything else
			  remotely associated with it.  But if it DOES, then
			  too damn bad. Don't come cryin' to me.
