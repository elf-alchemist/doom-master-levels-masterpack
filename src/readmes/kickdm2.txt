Description: 

This is a brand new WAD produced to celebrate Kick, the Hardcore Psycho Nitro
Drink in a Can. Not a total conversion, but we've put a bit of work into this 
baby - hope you like it!  It's been produced with permission from ID Software -
thanks guys. . . Give Kick a try, after this level, we think you'll agree it 
does a little more for you than Alpine Spew. . .

You're a veteran Quality Control Manager at a Kick bottling plant.  Your 
world is one of suits and ties, tests and reports, but above all making sure 
that every bottle of Kick that hits the streets is a brain-mashing brew of 
nitro-driven fizz.

You are not having a good day.

The line has been shut down and you pulled the cord.  You didn't need a 
spectrometer to know that something was wrong - this batch was weak, it did 
nothing for mouth or mind.  It lacked, well. . . Kick.

So you, with loosened tie and your jacket on a hook were crawling through 
passageways trying to find the problem.  Storage tanks, feeder pipes, filling 
nozzles, just what you expected. . .but wait.  What's that?  Out of a newly cut
scar on the side of an otherwise pristine wall came a crudely fashioned pipe.  
Clumsily welded to a major feeder main, it disappeared into the darkness.

Punching a small hole in the pipe with a screwdriver, the liquid that dripped
to the ground confirmed what you already feared  - it was Alpine Spew. Someone
was using Alpine Spew to take the kick out of Kick!  You could already hear
them echoing up from below:  Surfer Mutants with Flattops shouting "Hey Dude!"
The screams of flying two liter bottles with teeth so sharp they'd tear you 
apart faster than the Spew itself.  And most chilling, the taunts of a musty 
old lounge singer: "C'mere baby. . ."  It sounded like he wanted your career 
to be over too.

Something had to be done and you were the man to do it.  Tie off, armed only 
with the pistol from your desk and a can of Kick you crawled into the inky 
abyss.  It was time to Kick some Alpine ass. . .
