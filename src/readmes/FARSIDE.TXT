Description             : Given your success with the UAC mining
			  base and the Anomaly investigation, it
			  was inevitable that you get picked for
			  this foray into the Titan Farside Research
			  Base. Oh well. Rumours have it that some
			  prototypes of alien technology are being
			  tested here. Please investigate and
			  report.
