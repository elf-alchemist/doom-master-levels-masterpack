Description             : DANTE'S GATE is the first level in my INFERNO series.
			  The level has an entirely different look and feel.
			  For the most part, the only "theme" I had in mind was
			  to make the level as aesthetically pleasing and
			  consistent as possible.  But there is a storyline:

			  After all this wackiness at the UAC base, you have
			  lost track of your lady-friend, BEATRICE.  How the
			  two of you ever got separated is no great mystery,
			  what with all these demons and devils running about,
			  but you're damned if you're going to go through
			  Hell for nothing.  The only other survivor besides
			  yourself and Beatrice is VIRGIL, the beatnik space
			  poet.  He last saw Beatrice by one of the warp-
			  gates.  Chances are she made it through -- but
			  what's on the other side?

			  Only one way to find out.  You'll have to go
			  through DANTE'S GATE.

Instructions		: Put DANTE25.WAD and DANTE25.BAT in your DOOM
			  directory, then type "DANTE25."

Disclaimer		: I assume no responsibility for anything of any sort
			  in any way, shape, or form, now, then, henceforeward,
			  in this life (or the next several) for any screw-ups
			  or even minor inconveniences this PWAD causes you,
			  your family, your relatives, friends, ancestors,
			  associates, employers, pets, neighbors, lovers,
			  deities (major AND minor), nor any other person --
			  living, dead, or undead -- that you have or will ever
			  have any contact with in even the slightest form.
			  This PWAD has been tested and tested ad infinitum, so
			  it shouldn't mess with your computer or anything else
			  remotely associated with it.  But if it DOES, then
			  too damn bad.  Don't come cryin' to me.  

Grammar Lecture		: "a lot" is two words, not one; it's "you're," not
			  "your" -- as in "you are" unless you're (see?) using
			  the possessive in your (uh huh) text descriptions;
			  "their" indicates possession, "there" indicates
			  place or direction.

Known Bugs              : No bugs, but a nodes builder I tested on this	
			  level ages ago apparently has embedded some
			  information into the PWAD (according to its
			  author), which has been used to claim that I
			  used that nodes builder -- TBSP -- on DANTE'S
			  GATE to some extent. Such is not the case. As you
			  can see from the above list (and from checking
			  previous text files in earlier versions), I have
			  always given credit to any utility I use with any
			  frequency whatsoever. Something I used once or
			  twice gets no mention unless it had a significant
			  effect on the integrity, overall design, or final
			  output of the PWAD.
