Description             : Well, you know the story. UAC keeps sending
                          you different places on Titan to investigate 
                          various strange occurences. You keep telling
                          them that there are aliens on Titan.
                          You reported this after nearly getting your
                          head taken off in the Mines. You told them
                          again when they lost the Anomaly site. Your
                          investigation of the loss of communication
                          at the Farside base also mentioned this.
                          They're starting to believe you, I think,
                          except for the Psychology department
                          anyway - they're still holding out for their
                          space psychosis theory. Its a compromise,
                          you're being sent again, but as usual, you
                          only get a pistol... just in case there aren't
                          any aliens after all.

Play notes:               486/66 recommended

			  Co-op has been supported with extra armor
			  and health. As a result you may have to
			  pick up about 10-15 items before the co-op
			  UV game will save. Frame rates may not be
			  real good either.

			  Deathmatch is not encouraged or supported
			  by this wad. It is far too large and complex
			  for any kind of decent match.
