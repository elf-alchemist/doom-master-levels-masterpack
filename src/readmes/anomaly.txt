Description             : While exploring for new mines on Titan
			  (someone fragged the old one - darn!)
			  UAC discovered the remains of an alien
			  base. A tight security lid was clamped
			  on the find, referred to only vaguely
			  as the Anomaly in reports. You've been
			  assigned the job of breaking in and
			  finding out whats going on.
			  
			  A UAC research base and security garrison
			  has grown up around the Anomaly, and you'll
			  begin your visit in the Security Holding
			  Area, where you'll be asked to show your
			  papers. Too bad you don't have any. You'll
			  need to explore the Vistor's Center (S), the
			  Science Admin. Building (N), the Security
			  Headquarters (E), and the Guard Barracks to
			  gain the keys that'll allow you access to
			  the Anomaly Research Area (W), where, if you're
			  lucky, you may just find an exit back home.
