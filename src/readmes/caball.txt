Description             : The seven maps included have all been released on idgames and Compuserve earlier, round about the time they were made (vintage 95, check the time stamps ;-). These are slightly altered versions of the original maps, made even more challenging to balance out the accumulative ammos gathered.

Additional Credits to   : Gregory "Acoma" Hyne and Andrew "Artful Dodger" Cornes, for much advice and feedback throughout the times the maps were made. If any of the maps should still be playable in deathmatch it would be because of these guys. Gregory Hyne placed out the sector roughs for Derelict Station (map 25) and I then proceeded to polish it up, or "make it beautiful" as Greg would put it, later also adding singleplayer support. Mr Hyne also contributed substantially to my second map - Watchtower (map 26), mostly through over-the-shoulder input of the strange going-ons of these weird new editors.

* What is included *

New levels              : 7 previously released maps, trimmed and collected sequentially.

* Play Information *

Game                    : DOOM2
Map #                   : MAP24 - MAP30. You'll have to do an "IDCLEV24" command to get to the first map.
Single Player           : prime target
Cooperative 2-8 Player  : not tested, hopefully works
Deathmatch 2-8 Player   : tested to work, but only really playable on the smaller maps. derelict (map25) worked particularily well during testing.
Difficulty Settings     : implemented, though the Ultra Violence mode definetely saw the most careful testing.
Play Notes              : NOT DESIGNED FOR FREELOOK! NOT DESIGNED FOR JUMPING! The maps were made long before source-ports added options like jumping and freelook, so results from applying these may vary.

* Construction *

Base                    : New verteces, linedefs and sectors from scratch.
Build Time              : Oodles of time. Well spent, in retrospect.
Editor(s) used          : Started my first map (map 27) in the first Doom editor that ran under Windows, whatever its name was (a pre-"DCK" Doom Construction Kit?). Then some maps got started in DEU, but they were all wrapped up using DETH. Playing with the thought of giving the maps the Doom Builder treatment and doing a full deluxe release of some kind, but who knows if there ever will be time for that. Absolutely no promises in that regard!
Known Glitches          : None. Its really tough on Ultra Violence, or so I find these days. Being super-stingy with ammo to make it past the first two maps should eventually give you enough weapons to get you through to the end. If its painfully tough and you absolutely have to play on Ultra Violence, go ahead and "IDFA" at the start of the first map to get you boosted in the beginning - you won't lose an eighth or anything. Whatever that is.
