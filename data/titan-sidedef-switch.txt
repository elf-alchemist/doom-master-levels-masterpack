James "Jim" Flynn' Titan series has various custom switch textures, which
overrides vanilla textures, since this came before Boom's special texture
lumps, ANIMATED and SWITCHES, leaving Flynn to make new ones from the
vanilla set. These need to be renamed in order to fix conflicts with other
levels, by way of having alternative textures that start with TT1/TT2 in
contrast to vanilla's SW1/SW2, being redefined in TEXTURE1, and set as proper
switches in SWITCHES. This file contains how these textures need to be renamed
in order to fix the aforementioned conflicts.
