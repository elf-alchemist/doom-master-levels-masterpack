# Master Levels Masterpack build script

The "Master Levels for Doom II" were by far the poorest official release by id Software in it's classic days.

In short it is a grabbag collection of various unstructured, unorganized WAD files, all made by various map authors with a wide variety of styles and design convetions.

Most of the authors involved in the project, made these maps with the intention of them being a part of larger episode overarching a certain theme, with John Anderson, for example, directing a series of 9 total levels theme around the first third of Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy, Inferno.

However, most of these authors would go on, after the release of the Master Levels release later, free public maps which continued or preceeded the former levels in continuity of level design flow.

With all this in mind, why should anyone play the official in their original amorphous format? Why should we accept the way things are? Why should we allow people to miss out on the great works of these authors just because the pieces are all over the place?

This script fixes that, all content by the authors past, present and future to the Master Levels is now brought together in a single WAD file for your enjoyment. All 45 relevant (plus 1 bonus) map are now fully playable as 5 separate, organized episodes.

Episodes include:
	* John "Dr. Sleep" Anderson's Inferno, 9 maps
	* Jim Flynn's Titan series, 6 maps
	* Sverre "Cranium" Kvernmo's Cabal episode, 12 maps + 1 secret
	* Chris Klie's fatigued techbase, 12 levels
	* The Lost Levels, by Tom Mustaine, Theresa Chasar and Tim WIllits, 6 maps
